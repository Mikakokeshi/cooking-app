# Chompchamp

Chompchamp is a recipe site that aims to make food preparation easy. 

In this day and age most people struggle to have work and life balance. This is often achieved by compromising health and nutrition. People  try to save time by skipping meals or by ordering fast food since they find cooking to be an inconvenience. The effects of this can be ameliorated by eating in fancy restaurants but at a cost.

Productive people try to find time to cook for themselves to ensure that they are getting the nutrients their body deserves. Chompchamp presents cooking as something fun and easy to pick up. Its main purpose is to make productive people even more productive as well as usher in people who do not cook.

### Development Process

This app was created as a final project for our 2nd term in Vivixx coding bootcamp. Having three weeks of experience in rails we needed a project that would allow us to practice MVC, CRUD and gems in rails.

We started off by using Trello to create ideas for this project. Chompchamp was inspired by a famous recipe site in Japan called cookpad. At the onset we did not really have a differentiating factor against similar apps currently in the market. So instead of competing with them directly we decided to make this into a cross between a cooking app and a productivity app.
